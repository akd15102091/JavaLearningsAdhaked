Example of Null Object Design Pattern

    A car rental service allows customers to rent different types of cars. However, some customers may request
    a car model that is not available in the rental service’s fleet. When this happens, the rental service
    needs a way to handle this situation gracefully without causing errors or disruptions to the customer.


How Null Object Design Pattern is helpful?
    The Null Object Design Pattern is helpful in this situation because it allows the rental service to 
    provide a “null” car object that can be used in place of a real car object when the requested car model
    is not available. This way, the customer can still use the car object without encountering null reference
    exceptions or other errors.
