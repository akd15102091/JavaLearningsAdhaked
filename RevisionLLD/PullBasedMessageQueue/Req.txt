### **Functional Requirements**

    1. Multiple producers can publish messages to the queue.
    2. Multiple consumers can independently read from the same queue.
    3. Per-consumer offset ensures each consumer reads at its own pace.
    4. Pull-based polling allows consumers to fetch messages on demand.
    5. Message TTL support skips expired messages during polling.
    6. FIFO ordering of messages for all consumers.
    7. Support for multiple named queues via QueueManager.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

    1. Thread-safe publishing and reading using locking.
    2. Low-latency operations with O(1) amortized publish/poll.
    3. Scalable design supporting many consumers and messages.
    4. Highly maintainable OOP structure with clear separation of concerns.
    5. Extensible architecture for adding DLQs, consumer groups, or partitions.
