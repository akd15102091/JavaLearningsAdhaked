Functional Requirements
    - Users can schedule meetings.
    - Meetings have:
        - room, start time, end time, organizer, participants.
        - A room cannot have overlapping meetings.

    - A user cannot have overlapping meetings.
    - Meetings can be cancelled.

    - Support queries:
        - Get meetings for room in a time range
        - Get meetings for a user in a time range

Non-Functional Requirements

    Ask the interviewer:
    “Do we expect concurrent scheduling from multiple threads?”
    They say YES → SDE-2 requirement.

    So you continue:
    In-memory solution.
    Must be thread-safe.
    High throughput.
    Avoid bottlenecks (no global lock).
