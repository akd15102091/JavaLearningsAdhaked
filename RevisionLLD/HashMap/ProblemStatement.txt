Here's how you can implement a thread-safe HashMap in Java without using Java's built-in concurrent maps 
like ConcurrentHashMap.


✅ Goal:
    - Implement a ThreadSafeHashMap<K, V> that:
    - Is safe to access from multiple threads.
    - Does not use Java's built-in synchronized collections (Collections.synchronizedMap(), ConcurrentHashMap, etc).
    - Uses your own synchronization strategy.

💡 Strategy :
    - We’ll use bucketized locking (also called lock striping):
    - Divide the map into multiple buckets (array of linked lists).
    - Each bucket has its own lock.
    - This allows concurrent access to different buckets with minimal contention.

🧱 Data Structures Used :
    - Node class: For key-value storage.
    - Array of buckets: Like in a regular HashMap.
    - Array of locks: One lock per bucket.


✅ Features :
    - Lock striping (independent locks for buckets).
    - Thread-safe put, get, and remove.
    - No built-in Java concurrent maps.
