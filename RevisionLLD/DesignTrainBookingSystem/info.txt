/**
* Single-file Java implementation of an SDE-2 level LLD for a train booking system.
* - Multiple trains
* - Multiple dates
* - Train search by source, destination, date
* - Booking system ensuring proper seat allocation (no overlapping reservations on same seat)
* - Print bookings per train per date
*
* Strategy:
* - Each Train has an ordered list of stations.
* - For each (train, date) we create a TrainInstance that maintains seat occupancy.
* - Seat occupancy is represented as a boolean[seats][segments] where segment = stations.size()-1
* A seat is available for booking from station i to j if all occupancy[seat][i..j-1] are false.
* - TrainInstance has a ReentrantLock to safely handle concurrent booking/search requests.
*
* This file contains a small demo in main() to show the seat-allocation behaviour requested in the prompt:
* "for a date, if station 1 to 3 and 6 to 10 seat is filled then user who books station 4 to 5 should be shown for booking"
