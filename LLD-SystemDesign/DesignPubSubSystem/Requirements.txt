- The Pub-Sub system should allow publishers to publish messages to specific topics.

- Subscribers should be able to subscribe to topics of interest and receive messages published to those topics.

- The system should support multiple publishers and subscribers.

- Messages should be delivered to all subscribers of a topic in real-time.

- The system should handle concurrent access and ensure thread safety.

- The Pub-Sub system should be scalable and efficient in terms of message delivery.



======================================

    - Observer Pattern: Subscribers register with a topic (observable), and when a publisher sends a message, all subscribers are notified.

    - Message Queue (BlockingQueue<String> messageQueue): Decouples message publishing and delivery. Ensures subscribers process messages asynchronously.

    - Background Dispatcher Thread (startMessageDispatcher()): Uses take() to block until a message is available. Ensures messages are delivered in the order they are received.

    - Improved Scalability:
        Publishers don't need to wait for subscribers.
        Subscribers receive messages at their own pace.
