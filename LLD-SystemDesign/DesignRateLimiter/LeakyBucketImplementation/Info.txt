💧 Leaky Bucket Concept:
    - Incoming requests go into a queue (bucket).
    - Requests are processed (leaked) at a constant rate.
    - If the bucket is full, new requests are dropped.



✅ Goal: Leaky Bucket per User
    Each user has:
        - Their own fixed-capacity queue (bucket)
        - A dedicated leak rate (number of requests allowed per second)
        - Requests are dropped if the queue is full
