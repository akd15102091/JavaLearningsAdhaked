1. Basic Notification Service
    - Supports multiple channels – Email, SMS, Push.

    - Channel abstraction using NotificationChannel interface and concrete implementations.
    - Simple Notification model with recipient, message, and type.

2. User Preferences
    - Added UserPreferenceService to store & retrieve user’s allowed notification channels.
    - Before sending a notification, service checks if the channel is enabled for the user.
    - Prevents sending through unwanted channels.

3. Exception Handling
    - Introduced NotificationException for handling known issues (invalid channel, delivery failure, etc.).
    - Caught and logged exceptions in the service layer to avoid system crashes.
    - Clear separation between:
        Business errors (e.g., channel not allowed)
        System errors (e.g., network failure)

4. Simple Retry Mechanism
    - Added retry logic (fixed number of attempts) for transient failures.
    - Prevents immediate drop of a message if sending fails once.
    - Controlled using maxRetries configuration.
