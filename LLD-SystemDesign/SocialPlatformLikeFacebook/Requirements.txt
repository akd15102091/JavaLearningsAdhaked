| Pattern                   | Where It’s Used                                                  | Purpose                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Singleton**             | `AuthService`, `NotificationService`                             | Ensures a single shared instance for globally used services.                                                 |
| **Factory (Implicit)**    | `new User()`, `new Post()`                                       | While not explicitly abstracted, the object creation logic can evolve into factories.                        |
| **Strategy (Extensible)** | `Visibility`, `PrivacySettings`                                  | Defines access behavior for posts/profiles and can be extended easily (e.g., group-based visibility).        |
| **Observer (Conceptual)** | `NotificationService.notify()`                                   | Simulates notifying users of likes/comments. A full observer pattern can be introduced for real-time events. |
| **Service Layer**         | `AuthService`, `FriendshipService`, `PostService`, `FeedService` | Abstracts business logic and coordinates between entities and data.                                          |
